A simple tool to help the users to manage cache files of wp super cache.

== Description ==

This is a simple plugin to help the users to manage cache files of wp super cache.

Due to the cache management in WPSC is too weak. Sometimes, We need to delete one or multiple cache pages or even a category cache of wp suer cache, so we have to delete it via SSH.

This plugin will show all caches of WPSC, and you could delete one or multiple cache files or folders.

WP Super cache(WPSC) is my favorite cache plugin, so I developed this plugin to help myself manage cache files, and hope it will help someone else has the same needs.

This plugin is based on WP super cache, you should install WPSC first, or this plugin do nothing.

This plugin does not have any options to set.
